Created for outlining your Latvian border running route on 18th of November!

This app can be used to outline the route and use it to create a more accurate route on Strava routes or manually.
Usage of publically available data: OSM and mapbox routing. Thank you. Also I was too lazy to hide my token, don't abuse the limits!
